# LifeTracker

A personal life-tracking web app that runs entirely as a static site on GitHub Pages. No backend, no build step, no external APIs. All data lives in `localStorage`. The app is a collection of standalone HTML files — a home dashboard linking out to dedicated trackers for different areas of life.

A gamified stats page companion to the PPL tracker, themed after Solo Leveling.

- **Stats tab** — animated hunter profile card with rank badge (E through S), total XP, overall rank progress bar, and per-muscle attribute levels visualized on an anime-style SVG body diagram with glowing connectors
- **Quests tab** — daily, weekly, and milestone quests with progress bars and XP rewards
- **Feats tab** — achievement grid that unlocks as milestones are hit, with toast-style unlock notifications
- Reads from the same `ppl_v3` localStorage key as `fitness.html`
- Back button (← PPL) returns to `fitness.html`

### Habits (`habits.html`)
- Define up to 10 habits with a name, emoji, and frequency (daily or specific days of the week)
- **Today tab** — large tappable habit rows with live streak counts; tap to mark complete, tap again to unmark
- **This week tab** — 7-day completion grid (rows = habits, columns = days), today highlighted
- **Manage tab** — add, edit, and delete habits
- Stats strip: best streak, total completions this month, week completion rate

### Media (`media.html`)
- Three tabs: Movies, TV, Books
- Each entry: title, creator (director/author), genre, rating (1–10), status, date added, review/notes
- TV shows track seasons watched as a separate field

- Stats view: total tracked, average rating, top cuisines, cities breakdown
- **Import:** Google Maps saved list CSV (Title/Note/URL columns fully parsed), generic CSV, or JSON backup — with duplicate detection and preview before confirming
- **Export:** JSON backup download
- Cards show inline 🗺 Maps link when a URL is stored; tap the card body to edit
- **Delete:** ✕ button directly on each card for quick deletion, or via trash icon inside the edit modal

## Technical Notes

- Every `.html` file is fully self-contained with inline CSS and JS — no external dependencies except Google Fonts and Lucide icons (both loaded via CDN, pinned versions)
- Lucide icons: `cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lucide@0.383.0/dist/umd/lucide.min.js`
- Google Fonts: DM Serif Display + DM Sans (light pages), Barlow Condensed + Barlow (fitness pages), Rajdhani + Orbitron (hunter stats page)
- No frameworks, no npm, no build step — open any file directly in a browser or serve from GitHub Pages
- Works offline after first load (CDN resources cached by browser)
- localStorage quota errors are caught and surface a user-facing message

---

## Deployment

1. Put all files in the root of a GitHub repository
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**, set source to the `main` branch, root folder
3. GitHub Pages will serve the site at `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/`

No configuration needed.

- Added `if(window.lucide)` guard before every `lucide.createIcons()` call so a CDN failure degrades gracefully instead of throwing and crashing the page

### v1.1.0 — Fitness tracker replaced with PPL workout app
- Replaced generic `fitness.html` with a full Push / Pull / Legs workout tracker (original dark-theme app)
- Added `hunter-stats.html` as a gamified companion page (Solo Leveling theme) with muscle attribute SVG diagram, rank system (E→S), quests, and achievements
- Both pages use `ppl_v3` as their shared localStorage key
- Added `← Home` back button to `fitness.html` top bar linking to `index.html`
- Updated `← PPL` back button in `hunter-stats.html` to correctly point to `fitness.html`
- Updated home dashboard (`index.html`) fitness stat card to read from `ppl_v3` instead of `lifetracker_v1_fitness`, now displays weekly sessions and current streak

### v1.1.1 — Restaurant tracker: Google Maps CSV import fix + inline delete

**Problem 1 — CSV parser broken for Google Maps exports**

The original `parseCSV` function split every line on commas naively. Google Maps CSV exports include URLs in the `URL` column that contain commas inside their `data=` query parameters (e.g. `https://www.google.com/maps/place/Name/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x...`). This caused every row to be misaligned — the URL fragment would be interpreted as extra columns, the restaurant name would be picked up correctly, but the Note field and everything after the URL would be garbage or empty.

Additionally, Google's CSV uses the column names `Title`, `Note`, `URL`, `Tags`, and `Comment`, but the old parser only checked for `name`, `restaurant`, `cuisine`, `neighborhood` etc. — so even with correct parsing, nothing would have mapped to the right fields.

**Fixes applied to `restaurants.html`:**
- Replaced `parseCSV` with a full RFC 4180-compliant parser (`parseCSVRobust`) that correctly handles quoted fields containing commas, embedded newlines, and escaped double-quotes (`""`) — exactly what Google's CSV format requires
- Added `parseGoogleCSV` which auto-detects Google Maps format by checking for `title` and `url` headers, then maps: `Title` → name, `Note` + `Comment` (joined with ` · ` if both present) → notes, `URL` → stored maps URL
- Falls back to a generic column-name mapping for non-Google CSV files (`name`/`restaurant`/`title`, `cuisine`, `neighborhood`/`city`, `status`, `rating`, `notes`, `url`)
- Google imports default to status `Want to Go` (saved lists = places you want to visit)
- Blank rows (Google's CSV has a blank second row as a separator) are filtered out
- Duplicate detection in the import preview now correctly counts and reports how many entries already exist by name, and skips them on confirm
- Import preview shows the first 3 names plus a count of remaining entries

**Problem 2 — No way to delete entries without opening the edit modal**

**Fix applied:**
- Added a small `✕` delete button (`r-del-btn`) to the right side of every restaurant card in the list view
- Tapping it calls `quickDelete(id)` which confirms via a native dialog and removes the entry immediately without opening any modal
- Delete from within the edit modal (trash icon button) still works as before — both paths are available

**Other improvements in this update:**
- `url` field added to the add/edit modal ("Google Maps URL") so links can be manually entered or edited after import
- Each card now shows a `🗺 Maps` link inline in the meta row when a URL is stored; the link opens in a new tab and does not trigger the edit modal
- Notes search: the search bar now also searches inside notes text, not just name/cuisine/neighborhood
- `escHtml` helper added throughout card rendering to prevent XSS from restaurant names or notes containing `<`, `>`, `&`, or `"`

### v1.2.0 — Restaurant tracker: Leaflet map + Elo ranking minigame

**New: Map view**

A full-width Leaflet.js (OpenStreetMap tiles, no API key required) map added as a second tab in `restaurants.html`. Custom SVG pin markers colored by status — terracotta for Visited/Favorite, slate-blue for Want to Go. Tapping a pin shows a popup with name, cuisine, neighborhood, status, rating, Elo rank (if ranked), a notes preview, and an Edit button.

Geocoding uses Nominatim (OpenStreetMap's free geocoding service). Coordinates are fetched automatically in the background when a new manual Visited entry is saved. For imported entries, a `📍 Locate` button appears on the card in list view and in a "Missing location" panel below the map. Coordinates are stored as `lat`/`lng` on each restaurant object.

**New: Elo ranking minigame**

A head-to-head comparison game for ranking visited restaurants relative to each other. Uses a binary search algorithm over the ranked pool (sorted by Elo score, best to worst). Each round picks the midpoint of the current search window and asks "Better / Same / Worse." The window narrows after each answer until it's ≤ 1 entry wide, "Same" is selected, or the max comparison count (log₂(pool size) + 2, capped at 7) is reached. Standard Elo formula (K=32) applied to both participants for every comparison.

- **Manual entries:** Elo game launches automatically after saving a new Visited/Favorite restaurant, or when an existing entry is changed to Visited status
- **Imported entries:** marked with `imported: true`. A `⚡` rank button appears on the card and in the Ranking view. The game is triggered manually so bulk imports don't immediately bombard with comparison prompts
- Initial Elo seed derived from the numeric rating: rating × 100 + 700 (so a 5/10 → 1200, 10/10 → 1700, 1/10 → 800). Unrated entries start at 1200
- Result screen shows final rank (#N out of N), tier badge (S/A/B/C/D based on percentile), and Elo score

**New: Ranking view (tab)**

A dedicated tab showing the full ranked leaderboard sorted by Elo, with rank number, tier badge, raw Elo score, match count, and the existing 1–10 rating. Unranked visited entries appear below the leaderboard with a `⚡` button to start ranking.

**Tier system** (percentile-based, updates as the pool grows):
- S — top 5%
- A — top 6–20%
- B — top 21–45%
- C — top 46–70%
- D — bottom 30%

**Other changes in this version:**
- Nav stats bar replaced with a 4-tab row: List / Map / Ranking / Stats
- `eloRating`, `eloGames`, `eloRanked`, `imported`, `lat`, `lng` fields added to all restaurant entries (backward-compatible: missing fields are treated as defaults)
- Elo rank badge (`#N`) displayed on list cards for ranked visited entries; top 3 get gold styling
- Sort-by "Elo rank" option added to filter panel
- Stats view gains two new stat cards: "Elo ranked" count and "On map" count
- Import toast updated to remind user to mark entries as Visited and tap ⚡ to rank
